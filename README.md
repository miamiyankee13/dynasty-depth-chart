# Dynasty Depth Chart

## What this app is

**Dynasty Depth Chart** is a fast, frontend-only web app for viewing and manually managing dynasty fantasy football depth charts across multiple leagues.

It is designed to be:

- **Minimal** — no unnecessary UI, no configuration screens
- **Fast** — instant load, instant interaction
- **Data-dense** — show what matters, where you need it
- **Manual by design** — you control ordering, not projections

The app connects to Sleeper by username, fetches league and roster data client-side, and lets you:

- View all leagues in one place
- Organize players by position and depth
- Reorder players via drag-and-drop
- Persist your own depth chart edits locally
- See dynasty trade values as a subtle reference (not a ranking engine)
- View your current and future rookie draft picks by year

This tool is meant to mirror how experienced dynasty players *actually* think about their teams:  
as evolving depth charts and draft capital, not optimized lineups.

## What this app intentionally does **not** do

Dynasty Depth Chart is opinionated. The following omissions are deliberate.

- **No lineup optimization**  
  It does not tell you who to start, who to bench, or how to maximize points.

- **No projections, grades, or recommendations**  
  There are no rankings, tiers, or “expert takes” built into the UI.

- **No automatic roster logic**  
  The app will not auto-sort, auto-tier, or auto-manage your team.

- **No backend or accounts**  
  There is no server, no database, and no user profile beyond your browser.

- **No league management or transactions**  
  You cannot make trades, waiver claims, or lineup changes from this app.

- **No attempt to be everything**  
  This is not a draft tool, a trade calculator, or a league hub.

If a feature would add noise, reduce speed, or take control away from the user, it does not belong here.

> This app exists to reduce friction, not to replace judgment.
